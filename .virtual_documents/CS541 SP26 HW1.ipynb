    Estimate P(at least one shared birthday among n people) via simulation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of people (assume n <= 365).
    t : int
        Number of independent simulation trials.
    seed : int or None
        Random seed for reproducibility.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Fraction of trials (out of t) that had at least one birthday collision.

### RUN THIS CELL AFTER IMPLEMENTING AND RUNNING YOUR FUNCTION ABOVE ######


# After implementing your solution above, you should see the large of law numbers in action if you implemented your
# funtction correctly. As the number of trials increases, the fraction of trials with collisions stabilizes around
# the true probability
